<ul>

<li>The exam will cover everything up to and including loops and events (weeks 1-3 inclusive). The exam will consist of about 5 short answer questions and two small-ish programming tasks</li>
<li>The short answer questions may ask you to determine the input/output of the code or may be similar to the kinds of questions you see on the quizzes.</li>
<li>The programming tasks will ask you to write the JavaScript functions to perform a task. This may include getting input (textbox or prompt), giving output (console, alert, write to webpage), and will definitely include if/else, loops, and events (click and key).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The exam is partially open book. You can use any course resources including notes, labs, assignments, D2L, and the textbook. However you are not allowed to work with any other person.
